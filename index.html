            The rules are simple. Either of you or the machine will get to bat first.<br>
            While "batting" or "bowling", you can pick a number between 0 and 6.<br>
            If the bowling side picks the same number as the batting side, the batsman is considered "out".<br>
            Else, the batting team's score increases by whatever number they picked.<br>
            0 works differently; the batting team's score increases by whatever value the bowling side picked,
            except 0 in which case the batting team is out.<br>
            Whoever scores the most wins!
